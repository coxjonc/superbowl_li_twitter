# Your shell script to automatically upload data to s3 should look something
# like this.

# These lines activate your python virtualenv. This approach works with virtualenvwrapper.
# If you're using vanilla virtualenv you'll have to change this and export your env variables
# manually. See the README for information about which env variables need to be set.

# source ~/.bashrc
# source ~/.virtualenvs/your-virtual-env/bin/activate
# source ~/.virtualenvs/your-virtual-env/bin/postactivate

# The line below runs the python script that handles the upload. Again, you'll need to change the 
# paths to your python binary and project as necessary

# ~/.virtualenvs/<your-virtual-env>/bin/python ~/Dev/superbowl_social/bin/sql_to_s3.py

# Your script here
